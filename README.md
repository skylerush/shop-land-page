# If you're seeing this, first of all...

Let’s split it into cases:

---

### A. You’re a Shenkar student.

**A Answer:**  
Look, if you’re one of those clueless Shenkar students digging for something to submit — do yourself a favor and close this tab.  
You’re not gonna understand half of it, and no, I’m not here to save your grade.  
This project isn’t hard — it’s just a waste of time. But if even this feels like a challenge to you… good luck surviving the real world, champ.

### B. You’re the lecturer.

**B Answer:**  
Welcome. I hope this beautiful, time-sucking, two-page garden tools website lives up to the assignment expectations.  
It’s clean, responsive, and technically flawless.  
And yes — I know it’s a simple task, but it still managed to eat hours of my life for no good reason.  
Enjoy. (IGNORE C)

### C. You’re none of the above.

**C Answer:**  
How’d you end up here?  
Well, never mind. Do whatever you want with this shitass 7 files piece of shit so-called “website.”  
I built it purely to tick off a checkbox slapped together by the institution known as Shenkar™ — not because I needed to prove I can write HTML.  
I’ve been writing code for over a decade — long before the students here even knew how to open a browser dev console and check the network tab.  
So yeah. Use it, abuse it, print it out and frame it. I literally could not care less.
