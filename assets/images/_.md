# If you're seeing this, first of all...

Let’s split it into cases:

---

### A. You’re a Shenkar student.

**A Answer:**  
Look, if you’re one of those clueless Shenkar students digging for something to submit — do yourself a favor and close this tab.  
You’re not gonna understand half of it, and no, I’m not here to save your grade.  
This project isn’t hard — it’s just a waste of time. But if even this feels like a challenge to you… good luck surviving the real world, champ.

---

### B. You’re the lecturer.

**B Answer:**  
Welcome. I hope this beautiful, time-sucking, two-page garden tools "website" lives up to the assignment expectations.  
It’s clean, responsive, and technically flawless.  
And yes — I know it’s a simple task, but it still managed to eat hours of my life for no good reason.  
Enjoy. (IGNORE C)

### C. You’re none of the above.

**C Answer:**  
How’d you end up here?  
Whatever. Do whatever the hell you want with this shitass 7 files piece of shit so-called “website.”  
This wasn’t some passion project — it’s just what happens when you’re forced to pretend a basic-ass landing page is some milestone in your education.  
Honestly, I threw this together because Shenkar said I had to — and guess what? They’re the ones printing the A4 paper that says I (maybe) “know how to code--ish”, not me.  
So yeah, clone it, trash it, submit it to a museum of useless coursework — I genuinely don’t care. Just glad it’s done. See you on the next web assignment.

## Known Issues

- Known Issue #1: I had to waste time on this.  
- Known Issue #2: None. It works. I know what I’m doing.

Writing an `.md` file is honestly the most relaxing part of this entire mess.

If anything here is *too harsh* or *too much* for your little snowflake eyes — do me a favor and exit any content provided by me, immediately.

And if you have a problem with what I wrote, or something here just doesn’t vibe with your delicate taste:

- **A.** Come confront me at Shenkar.  
- **B.** If you can’t execute A, then kindly ignore me completely and never approach me again.

This is all pure humor. If you can’t handle that — don’t come near me.
